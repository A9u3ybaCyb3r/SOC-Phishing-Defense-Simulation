# Phase 7: Actions on Objectives

## üåü Objective:

Exfiltrate sensitive data, establish fallback access, and erase evidence to avoid detection.

### Steps:

#### Creating a New User Account

* The attacker creates a user named `guest` with password `Password123` to establish fallback access:

  ```bash
  net user guest Password123 /add
  ```

* This ensures the attacker can re-enter the system even if the current session is terminated.

---

#### Dumping Credentials

* The attacker uses tools like **LaZagne** to extract saved credentials from the system.
* Recovered passwords may be used to escalate privileges or access external accounts.

---

#### Exfiltrating Data

* The attacker locates a folder named `secret_folder` and downloads `important_doc.txt`:

* The stolen file likely contains confidential or valuable information.

---

#### Deleting Local Evidence

* The attacker deletes the `Secret Storage.txt` file to remove traces of data access:

  ```bash
  del "Secret Storage.txt"
  ```

---

#### Covering Tracks

* The attacker removes the newly created user account:

  ```bash
  net user guest /delete
  ```

* The attacker clears the **System** and **Security** logs using `wevtutil` to wipe forensic evidence:

  ```bash
  wevtutil cl System
  wevtutil cl Security
  ```

* This hinders incident responders from reconstructing the attack timeline.

## ‚úÖ Attack Phase Complete

The attacker has successfully compromised the system, extracted sensitive data, and covered their tracks.

‚û°Ô∏è Proceed to the [Incident Response Phase](https://github.com/A9u3ybaCyb3r/Cyber_Defense_Lab/blob/main/Incident%20Response/Preparation.md) to begin detection, containment, and recovery.
