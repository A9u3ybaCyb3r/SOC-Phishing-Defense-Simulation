# Phase 3: Delivery

## ðŸŒŸ Objective:
Deliver the malicious payload to the victim in a way that convinces them to execute it.

### Steps:
#### Hosting the Payload:
- The attacker hosts the payload using Pythonâ€™s built-in HTTP server:
  ```bash
  python3 -m http.server 8080
  ```
- This makes the payload accessible for download via HTTP on port **8088**.

### Command Explanation:

```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

1. `python3` â€“ Runs Python version 3.
2. `-m http.server` â€“ Uses Pythonâ€™s built-in web server module to start a temporary HTTP server.
3. `8080` â€“ Specifies that the server should run on port 8080 (you can change this to any available port).

### Output of the Command:

  - `"Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8080"` â€“ The server is now running and accessible from any computer on the network.
  - `"http://0.0.0.0:8080/"` â€“ You (or others on the network) can access it by typing `http://your-ip:8080/` in a web browser.

### What This Means:

  - If you run this command in a folder, Python will share all the files in that folder over HTTP.
  - You can download files from this machine by visiting `http://your-ip:8080/` in a browser or using `wget` or `curl`.
  - Useful for quick file sharing or setting up a local web server for testing.

#### Creating the Phishing Email:
- The attacker crafts a convincing email pretending to be from tech support.
- Use [Emkei's Fake Mailer](https://emkei.cz/) a tool that allows you to send emails with a forged sender address. This helps craft a **legitimate-looking email** for the target.

- The body of the email contains a shortened URL (via a URL shortening service) to hide the actual HTTP link to the payload.
    - Use **URL Shortening** via [Bitly](https://app.bitly.com/Bp21hrdeijm/links) to obscure the destination and make the link appear more legitimate.
    - **Steps to Create a Shortened URL**:
        - Please make sure your **Python HTTP Server** is running (as the previous step) and open **Firefox**.
        - Visit `http://{your local machine IP}:8080` to access the payload.
        - **Right-click** the payload and select **Copy Link**.

        -  Paste the link in the **Destination bar** and click **Create your link**.

        - The result will be a **shortened URL** that hides the true destination.
