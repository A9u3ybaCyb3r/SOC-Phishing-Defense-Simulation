# 🔍 Reconnaissance Phase

## 🎯 Objective
Collect publicly available information — including emails and social media — to prepare a targeted phishing attack.

### 🧾 Steps

#### 🕵️ Information Gathering
- The attacker locates the victim’s LinkedIn profile.
- They extract the victim’s publicly listed email address.

## 🧪 Simulation Context
For this lab, we assume the attacker has already gathered the necessary intelligence to craft a convincing phishing email and payload.

## 📨 Temporary Email for Testing
We use [Temp Mail](https://temp-mail.org/en) to simulate a victim’s inbox. This disposable address will receive the phishing email during the attack demonstration.
