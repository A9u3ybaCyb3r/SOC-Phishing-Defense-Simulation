## Objective:

This project simulates a phishing attack in a controlled lab and demonstrates the full incident response lifecycle preparation, detection, analysis, and mitigation using tools like Splunk, Snort, Sysmon, and LimaCharlie. It follows both the **NIST Incident Response Plan** and **Cyber Kill Chain** to build hands-on experience in detecting threats, analyzing attacker behavior, and identifying Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).

# üß© Overview of the Project

## Defense Scenario

This project is structured around the **NIST Incident Response Lifecycle**, providing a hands-on simulation of how security teams prepare for, detect, contain, and recover from cyberattacks. Each phase includes specific tools, configurations, and techniques to demonstrate professional blue team operations.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è 1. **Preparation Phase**

> *Goal: Build resilience before an incident occurs.*

In this phase, the environment is configured for maximum visibility and alerting:

* **Snort IDS** rules are written to detect suspicious traffic (e.g., reverse TCP shells, HTTP anomalies).
* **LimaCharlie EDR** is deployed to monitor endpoint activity and trigger YARA-based detections.
* **Sysmon** is configured to capture low-level Windows event logs.
* **Splunk SIEM** is set up to ingest, correlate, and alert on Snort, Sysmon, and LimaCharlie logs.
* **Forensic tools** like FTK Imager, Registry Explorer, and KAPE are prepared for post-breach analysis.
* **User awareness training and phishing detection preparation** are implied by the simulated threat.

---

### üí• 2. **Detection and Analysis Phase**

> *Goal: Identify, validate, and analyze the incident as early as possible.*

After the phishing attack is triggered, this phase focuses on **identifying and understanding the threat**:

* **Snort** triggers alerts on known attack patterns (e.g., port 4444 reverse shell).
* **Splunk dashboards** visualize and correlate incoming Snort, Sysmon, and EDR logs.
* **LimaCharlie** detects process anomalies and file creation events via YARA rules.
* Analysts **map attacker behavior** using the MITRE ATT\&CK Framework and **validate IOCs** such as file names, IP addresses, and system modifications.

---

### üö® 3. **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery Phase**

> *Goal: Minimize damage, remove the threat, and restore systems to normal.*

Once detection confirms the compromise:

* **Containment** steps include tagging compromised systems with LimaCharlie and disabling reverse shell activity.
* **Eradication** involves removing the malware and terminating unauthorized accounts or processes.
* **Recovery** includes restoring system integrity and re-enabling services after forensic validation.

Logging and forensic evidence are preserved for future analysis or reporting.

---

### üìò 4. **Post-Incident Activity Phase**

> *Goal: Learn from the incident and strengthen defenses.*

After resolving the attack:

* The team reviews logs, alerts, and actions taken to evaluate effectiveness.
* Lessons learned are documented, including:

  * Which alerts triggered early enough?
  * Were any gaps found in detection logic?
  * How did the environment respond under simulated stress?

This feedback loop leads to updated Snort/YARA rules, improved automation, and better training for future incidents.

## Attack Scenario 

This simulation models a realistic phishing-based compromise on a standalone **Windows 10** machine. The attack follows the **Cyber Kill Chain** framework, progressing through all key adversarial phases:

---

### üõ∞Ô∏è 1. **Reconnaissance**

The attacker gathers intelligence on the target organization through publicly available information (OSINT), identifying an employee and crafting a believable phishing lure.

---

### ‚úâÔ∏è 2. **Weaponization**

A **malicious payload** is created using **Metasploit**, embedded in an executable file named to appear as a critical software update (e.g., `UrgentUpdate.exe`). The payload is configured to open a **reverse TCP shell** on port `4444`.

---

### üì§ 3. **Delivery**

The payload is delivered to the victim via **phishing email**, masquerading as an urgent internal IT update. The email contains social engineering tactics to trick the user into downloading and executing the file.

---

### üí• 4. **Exploitation**

Upon execution, the payload **exploits user trust**, not a system vulnerability. The reverse shell initiates a connection back to the attacker, establishing remote control of the system.

---

### üì° 5. **Installation**

A **Meterpreter session** is established. The attacker uploads tools, installs persistence mechanisms, and **creates a new administrative user account** to maintain long-term access.

---

### üïπÔ∏è 6. **Command and Control (C2)**

The attacker communicates with the compromised system via the **reverse TCP shell**, using encrypted Metasploit traffic to avoid detection. Commands are executed to further explore the host and maintain stealth.

---

### üì¶ 7. **Actions on Objectives**

The attacker achieves their primary goals:

* **Data exfiltration** of sensitive documents.
* **Log tampering and clearing** to cover tracks and evade detection.
