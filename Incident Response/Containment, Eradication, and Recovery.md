# üö® Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

## üîí Containment

* **Isolate compromised systems** from the network.

  * In **LimaCharlie**, isolate the system to cut off attacker communication:

* **Disable persistence mechanisms** such as registry-based backdoors.

  * Use **Autoruns** from Sysinternals Suite to inspect startup items.

  * Uncheck and then delete suspicious entries to disable attacker persistence:

## üîç Eradication

* **Use EDR tools to delete malware** (e.g., `SecurityUpdate.exe`).

  * In **LimaCharlie**, navigate to the file system and delete the malware:

  * You may optionally download the malware for sandbox analysis, but deletion is advised in recovery.

* **Blacklist attacker's IP address** using Windows Firewall:

  * Run the following commands in **Command Prompt as Administrator**:

    ```bash
    netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Blacklisted IP" dir=in action=block remoteip=10.19.19.134
    netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Blacklisted IP" dir=out action=block remoteip=10.19.19.134
    ```

## üîß Recovery

* **Restore compromised systems** from a known clean snapshot.

* **Validate integrity** before reconnecting to the network.

* **Conduct a post-remediation review** to verify that:

  * All IOCs are removed
  * No persistence remains
  * Logs confirm cleanup success

* If using a virtualization platform, such as VirtualBox, choose to restore from a saved state:

* Alternatively, **power off the virtual machine** and restore snapshot from the VirtualBox manager:
