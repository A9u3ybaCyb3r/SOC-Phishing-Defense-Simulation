- **Disable persistence mechanisms** (e.g., backdoors in the registry using Autoruns).

## Eradication

- **Use EDR solutions** to delete malware (e.g., SecurityUpdate.exe).
- **Blacklist the attacker's IP address** via Windows Firewall.

## Recovery

- Restore the compromised system from a clean snapshot.
- Verify system integrity before reconnecting to the network.
- Conduct a final review to ensure all traces of compromise are removed.
