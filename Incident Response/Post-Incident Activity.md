# ðŸ“„ Post-Incident Activity

## ðŸ“š Lessons Learned & Improvement

* **Monitoring effectiveness**: Evaluate whether detection tools like Splunk, Sysmon, YARA, or LimaCharlie successfully identified the threat across all phases.
* **Detection gaps**: Identify stages of the attack that evaded detection or were discovered late.
* **Response speed**: Assess how quickly the incident was detected, contained, and eradicated.

These insights should inform updates to your detection rules, playbooks, and staff training protocols.

## ðŸ“ƒ Final Documentation

* Create a detailed **Incident Report** that documents:

  * Initial infection vector (e.g., phishing email)
  * Timeline of attacker activity and detection
  * Containment and eradication steps
  * Tools and techniques used for analysis and recovery
  * IOCs and TTPs observed
* Conduct a **post-mortem meeting** with the team to:

  * Identify what went well
  * Pinpoint areas for improvement
  * Update the Incident Response Plan (IRP)

## ðŸ”¹ Conclusion

Following the **NIST Incident Response Framework** ensures a structured, proactive approach to handling cybersecurity incidents. By conducting thorough post-incident analysis and improving processes, organizations can:

* Increase detection accuracy
* Improve response time
* Enhance resilience against future threats

Every incident becomes a learning opportunity to build a stronger, more prepared security posture.
